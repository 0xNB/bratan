# Building Handlebars Templates #

This directory contains templates which need to be processed by the [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating
engine. Make sure you have this [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module installed and execute `handlebars *.html -f
templates.js` to generate compiled template definitions.
